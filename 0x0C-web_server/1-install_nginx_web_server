# Installs Nginx with the following configurations:
## server
## Nginx should be listening on port 80
## When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page)\
### using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
## As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine\
### to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
## You canâ€™t use systemctl for restarting nginx

# Update the package list
apt-get update

# Install Nginx
apt-get install -y nginx

# Start Nginx (no need to use systemctl)
service nginx start

# Configure Nginx to listen on port 80 and return "Hello World!" for requests to the root /
cat <<EOF > /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
server {
    listen 80;
    ubuntu;
    location / {
        echo "Hello World!";
    }
}
